### In short 

Developers Italia is the community dedicated to the development of open-source software to support Italian digital public services.

It is a change in the way the Public Administration operates, using open standards and software, creating SDKs 
for the main programming languages ​​and frameworks, publicly documented APIs, not having a legal language but a technical one, 
around which to engage a community of developers who create innovation.

### The role of the Team 

The Digital Team immediately became a promoter and took charge of the creation and structuring of the 
Developers Italia community. We decided to rely on standard market tools (GitHub for the code, ReadTheDocs for the documentation, 
Discourse for the forum), around which the main site was created (economically and within a few weeks) 
that presents the projects and indexes the activities. 

We then began to immediately involve the people who were approaching the project, through periodic online calls, 
open roadmaps and architectural documents. At the same time, we were meeting with the administrations that handle the major 
&quot;enabling platforms&quot; (being important central technologies on which to construct digital services) and began initiating 
a journey with them to bring the development of projects within Developers Italia.
