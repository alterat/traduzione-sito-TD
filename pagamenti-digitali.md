### In short 

A different and more natural way for citizens to pay the Public Administration, which becomes more immediate, faster, and cheaper for the country.

Citizens must be able to choose modern payment methods with minimal friction, whilst the market must be able to integrate, easily adding new innovative payment instruments. We want to render the system more open and flexible.

### Benefits for citizens and the public administration 

- an integrated multi-channel operation at a national level, with transparency in commission costs, that is, the citizen is offered additional possible payment channels
- uniformity of the paper notification and the possibility to notify the citizen digitally on the channels he or she prefers (notifications via app or the website of the selected PSP, SMS or email) 
- certainty of the due amount, with the possibility of obtaining the current amount (being that the sum to be paid is always the valid amount and that requested by the PA. If the amount varies over time due to late payment or other interest, PagoPA is always updated) 
- simplicity and speed of the process: simply enter the notice code (Unique Payment ID) to pay and receive the full amount. This means being certain that the PA has collected the payment and that there will be no subsequent verification or assessment.

### Benefits for Public Administrations 
- automatic reconciliation of takings
- reduction in transaction and processing costs 
- D+1 (next business day after payment) collection of amounts directly into treasury accounts 
- providing more collection channels, meaning earlier collection

### The data

### The role of the Team To allow PagoPA to evolve in a market logic, whilst permitting access to PagoPA for Public Administration services.
Improve the user experience by replicating the processes and methods already in use in the payments market and used daily by citizens.
Allow for the main players within the payment market to be able to offer their own tools to citizens, also for paying for Public Administration services.

We have thus created, in collaboration with AGID, the new functional specifications of the payment component of PagoPA, creating a simple and secure User Experience and a modern and engaging notification system.
These changes will soon be visible, with the larger municipalities having already become involved.
