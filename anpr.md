### In short

Today, our identities are dispersed throughout eight thousand municipal registers. We must 
unite them into a single registry, gaining in terms of efficiency and saving money and energy, 
so that citizens no longer have to worry about providing their personal data or 
change of residence to each Public Administration office, in order to simplify the 
variation procedures and to standardise them at a national level, so that it is possible to 
obtain certificates without the need to go to 
an official office.

### The benefits for citizens and the public administration

ANPR is an essential step in the digital agenda to render additional 
innovations possible, since having a database at a national level will allow for the advancement 
of the self-certification model by shortening and 
automating 
all procedures related to master data.

With ANPR, the administrations will be able to efficiently dialogue with each other, 
having a singular and reliable source for citizens&#39; data. Even today, however, 
ANPR allows citizens to obtain immediate benefits, such as the request for official 
certificates in all municipalities, making changing one&#39;s residence simpler and immediate, 
with the possibility of obtaining certificates from a single portal to be activated shortly.

### The Team&#39;s Role

ANPR is an essential step in rendering possible future innovations possible, which 
would be impossible or very expensive today. The project existed well before 
the birth of the Digital Transformation Team: we took over the direction with the 
aim of creating a clear roadmap for implementation, modernising the operative method and accelerating its completion. In our blog 
here below, we share our vision of the project, the actions taken so far and the next steps we wish to take. Follow us on Twitter for all

### Forum 
ANPR is a project of national relevance. To encourage discussion and 
an exchange of viewpoints, as well as to encourage the participation of 
all players involved in the project (starting from over 8,000 Italian
 municipalities involved in the operation!), we created a [forum](https://forum.italia.it/c/anpr)
