### In short 

Digital Citizenship aims to make interactions between citizens and the Public Administration easier and more familiar, by designing digital services around the citizen and his or her information.

Through an open platform of shared components on which to construct digital services, we will create an experience that will follow the citizens during their interactions with local and national services, as if it were the only great digital home of the citizen.

It will be a simpler and more familiar way for the Public Administration to communicate with citizens, provide deeds and reminders concerning deadlines, and share information and documents through an interface built around the citizen.

### The role of the Team 

The Digital Team immediately undertook a process of communication concerning the vision, coordination and alignment of all the initiatives already started or in the design phase, with the aim of creating a single ecosystem of national and shared components.

Finally, together with AgID, the team started the development of a number of projects that are fundamental for the realisation of Digital Citizenship: 

* The management component of preferences that will allow the citizen to centrally manage all the settings associated with his or her profile as a digital citizen, used to customise the digital services (for example, manage communication channels, language preferences, privacy settings, etc.).
* The communication component to establish a single channel that the Public Administration can use to send communications, notices and deadline reminders to the citizen.
* A web and mobile application that aims to provide a digital place for accessing the experience of Digital Citizenship, built around the citizen.
